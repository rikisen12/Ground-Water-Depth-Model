# Project Overview
## The project aims to:

### Predict the Stage of Ground Water Extraction (%) based on provided data.
### Compare performance between:
  #### Random Forest Regressor
  #### Deep Neural Network (DNN)
## The performance of each model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.

# Installation
## Clone this repository: (bash)

git clone https://github.com/your-username/groundwater-depth-prediction.git
cd groundwater-depth-prediction

## Install required Python packages: (bash)

pip install -r requirements.txt
Place the dataset file groundwater_depth.csv in the root directory.

# Dataset
